# EasySafe attack sketch
## Delete data from a filesystem

Adversary model: Restricted

Complexity: Infeasible

## Method
There is no message that causes peers to delete information in EasySafe. All pages and page tree chunks are immutable once written, and the restricted adversary has no capability to delete files from the storage device.
