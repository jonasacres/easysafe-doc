# EasySafe attack sketch
## Determine authorship of an encrypted page

Adversary model: Extreme

Complexity: 0

## Method
The model grants the adversary knowledge of the identities of each peer. The model also grants that the adversary knows the plaintext of every network message, and the contents of all peer filesystems in realtime.

The adversary can note which peer possesses or transmits an encrypted page first. The identity of the peer is the author of the page.

The adversary does not learn the content of the encrypted page.
